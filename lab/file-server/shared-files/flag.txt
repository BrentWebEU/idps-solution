FLAG{SMB_FTP_ACCESS_GRANTED_SECRET_DATA_FOUND}

Congratulations! You have successfully accessed the file server.

You have discovered sensitive company files including:
- Financial reports with database credentials
- Configuration files with API keys
- Employee directory with SSNs and passwords
- Backup scripts with AWS credentials

This demonstrates the risk of:
1. Weak file share permissions
2. Storing credentials in plain text
3. Insufficient access controls
4. Lack of data encryption

Next Steps for Attacker:
- Use discovered credentials to access database
- Pivot to internal systems using SSH credentials
- Exfiltrate sensitive customer data
- Establish persistence with discovered API keys

Remediation:
- Implement proper access controls (ACLs)
- Use encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Store credentials in secure vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Enable audit logging for file access
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
